# Description

This is a sample code repository for Spartacus implementation and extensibility. It showcases a set of code examples and concrete use cases on how to implement, extend and enhance Spartacus for CX customers, partners and implementors.

# Requirements

- SAP Commerce Cloud instance
  - Release 1905 recommended
  - Works with 1811 and 1808, with reduced functionality
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/): v8.0.0 or later, no greater than v9.0.0
- node.js: v10 or later, no greater than v12
- yarn: v1.15 or later

# Installation

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

# Limitations

It is recommended to use SAP Commerce 1905 and the latest version of Spartacus. Spartacus works with Release 1808 and 1811 of SAP Commerce Cloud, with some limitations.

Spartacus is also being updated so that it works well with upcoming releases of SAP Commerce Cloud. This means that certain features of Spartacus may only work with unreleased future editions of SAP Commerce Cloud. This will be noted as we release new versions of Spartacus.

Spartacus bootcamp sample code is provided "as-is" with no official lines of support.
