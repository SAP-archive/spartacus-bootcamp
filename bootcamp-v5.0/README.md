# Composable store 5.0 (spa-v5.0)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.

To install composable storefront 5.0, you need to download the composable storefront 5.0 libraries from the Repository Based Shipment Channel (RBSC), as described in the [following procedure](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_COMPOSABLE_STOREFRONT/cfcf687ce2544bba9799aa6c8314ecd0/5de67850bd8d487181fef9c9ba59a31d.html?version=5#downloading-composable%0Astorefront-libraries-from-the-repository-based-shipment-channel).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
